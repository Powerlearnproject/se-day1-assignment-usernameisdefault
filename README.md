List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process used to create high-quality software. It typically involves several phases, each with its specific goals and activities:
Requirement Gathering and Analysis: This phase involves understanding the client's needs and expectations, identifying the functionalities and features required for the software, and creating detailed requirements documents.
Design: The design phase focuses on creating a blueprint for the software, including its architecture, user interface, and data structures. This phase ensures that the software meets the specified requirements and is efficient and scalable.
Development: During the development phase, the actual coding of the software takes place. Developers implement the design specifications and create the necessary components.
Testing: Once the development is complete, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix any defects or bugs. Various testing techniques, such as unit testing, integration testing, and system testing, are employed to ensure the software's quality.   
Deployment: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment, where it becomes available to users. This phase may involve installation, configuration, and data migration.
Maintenance: Once the software is deployed, it requires ongoing maintenance to address issues, add new features, and improve performance. This phase includes activities like bug fixing, updates, and technical support.
These phases are typically followed in a sequential manner, but in agile methodologies, there is more flexibility and iteration between phases. The SDLC ensures a structured and disciplined approach to software development, leading to higher quality, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
The Waterfall and Agile methodologies are two popular approaches to software development, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.

Waterfall Methodology
